# Airbnb Market Analysis – NYC (Full Project Walkthrough)

## 📊 Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data in New York City to:

* Identify pricing patterns by region, neighborhood, and room type
* Understand how Airbnb presence affects long-term rental prices
* Forecast future price trends
* Generate insights for city planners, investors, and policy makers

---

## 🎯 Key Contributions

* Built a full ETL pipeline with Python and PostgreSQL
* Cleaned and enriched raw Airbnb listing data
* Performed EDA and statistical modeling to extract insights
* Visualized key KPIs using Tableau dashboards
* Forecasted monthly average price using regression models
* Wrote complex SQL queries with spatial joins to enrich data

## 🔍 Modules Breakdown

### `etl_pipeline.py`

* Removes nulls
* Filters invalid price listings
* Creates new features (e.g. month, price/min night)

### `eda_modeling.py`

* Generates boxplots and distribution plots
* Fits a linear regression model
* Runs time-series forecasting

### `spatial_queries.sql`

* Performs joins with zoning and census data
* Aggregates metrics for neighborhoods and boroughs

---

## 📈 KPIs Tracked

* Average Monthly Price
* Listings per Borough
* Top Room Types
* Availability 365
* Repeat Reviewers
* Regression Coefficients

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights (Tableau)

* Map of listings by neighborhood
* Filters by price, availability, room type
* KPIs and bar charts by borough and zip code

---

## ❓ Business Questions Answered

* Which boroughs have the highest and lowest prices?
* What listing types generate the most income?
* Are there seasonal price variations by month?
* How does availability vary by region?
* Which areas might be over/under saturated?

---

## 🔍 Example Output

* Boxplot of prices by borough (removing \$500+ outliers)
* Linear regression summary with R-squared and coefficients
* Predicted trendline of price vs. month
* Aggregated SQL summary by region
